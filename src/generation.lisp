;;;; Sidewinder
;;; The Sidewinder algorithm works by looping over each row.

;;; For each row it loops over the cells to form "runs" of consecutive
;;; horizontal neighbors, randomly deciding when to end a particular run.  Once
;;; a run is ended ("closed") it picks a random cell in the run and carves out
;;; a passage north.
;;;
;;; For the top row of the map we never want to carve out to the north wall, so
;;; we never allow the top row to close -- it'll always be a single run.  This
;;; results in a signature long corridor along the top of the maze.
